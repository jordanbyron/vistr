= Vistr: Ruby API for Blackboard Vista 

Vistr is an attempt at creating a Ruby API for Blackboard Vista: An online, 
JS-laden e-learning system.

== Progress

Despite the high reliance on javascript, I've had moderate success at logging in
and accessing basic information. With these hurdles overcome it should be fairly
simple to start getting at the meat of vista (Assignments, threads, mail, etc.)

== Why?

I'm taking an online course this semester and therefore using Vista. Rather
than constantly logging in to check assignments / updated notes I'd love to
create a nice, programmable interface that I can interact with.
