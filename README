= Vistr: Slip Beyond the JS Hell of Blackboard Vista

Vistr is an attempt at creating a Ruby API for Blackboard Vista: An online, 
JS-laden e-learning system.

== The deal

Most likely this won't work because of the extreme reliance on javascript.

== Why?

I'm taking an online course this semester and therefore using Vista. Rather
than constantly logging in to check assignments / updated notes I'd love to
create a nice, programmable interface that I can interact with. Make the system
work for me rather than against me.
