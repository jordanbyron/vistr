= Vistr: Ruby API for Blackboard Vista 

Vistr is an attempt at creating a Ruby API for Blackboard Vista: An online, 
JS-laden e-learning system.

== Requires

mechanize

  sudo gem install mechanize
  
== Use

  v = Vistr.new
  v.login "username", "password"
  v.course_list   # Returns courses you are enrolled in
  v.assignments   # Returns all assignments

== Why?

I'm taking an online course this semester and therefore using Vista. Rather
than constantly logging in to check assignments / updated notes I'd love to
create a nice, programmable interface that I can interact with.

== TODO

# Enable Vistr to access institutions other than Southern (Dynamically load 
glcid and institution name)
# Access course materials (Assignments, message threads, etc)
# Access vista mail
